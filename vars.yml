# Variables for the playbooks

# Your ansible user:  a Gaia CLISH user with access via Gaia API; not
# expert-level user Or use '-u NAME' with the script
ansible_user: "{{ gaia_admin_user |default('admin') }}"

# Your Gaia user password You can uncomment 'gaia_admin_password' below and
# enter the password here, in plain text (BAD IDEA), or create a vault in
# your inventory host_vars/group_vars (GOOD IDEA).
#
# To use a vault:
#   * Make a new file in your inventory host_vars or group_vars directory as
#   you wish.
#  * The variable is a dict named 'clish_users_vault':
#     key is the username
#     value is the plain text password (hang on...)
#  # Encrypt the vault with 'ansible-vault encrypt ...' Pass "-P" ot the
#   script and it will prompt for the vault passphrase
#
# (if you know what you're doing, then you can edit the script to use a
# vault script to fetch the passphrase, which is what I do)

# 'show configuration' for a host/gateway
#
# * For any Gaia host or gateway, if the CLISH command "show configuration"
# is passed to the script, this is passed as-is to the CLISH template.
#
# * For any VSX VS, if the CLISH command "show configuration" is passed to
# the script, this list is substituted and passed to the CLISH template. 
# You can edit this if you wish, but do so with caution, if you know what
# you're doing.  VSX folks usually do.  :)
